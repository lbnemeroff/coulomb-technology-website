*   **Sub-headline:** Coulomb Technology’s BESS Core cabinets provide a bankable, open-protocol sodium-ion foundation for system integrators, EPCs, and developers to build upon.
*   **CTA:** View BESS Core Products → (links to Series-DC, M, S on All Products page)
*   **Background:** Slideshow of BESS Core use cases (Data Centers, Telecom, Utility-Scale)

**Section 1: Bankable Economics — A Better Foundation**
*   **Headline:** 14% Lower TCO. Zero Headaches.
*   **Sub-headline:** Our sodium-ion technology delivers measurable savings through eliminated HVAC requirements, reduced degradation, and lower maintenance, insurance, and permitting costs — validated by real-world deployments, not laboratory projections.
*   **Visual:** TCO comparison chart from brochure (LFP vs. NFPP)
*   **Key Stats:**
    *   **$20.3/kWh:** Lifetime savings per kWh over project lifetime
    *   **20yr:** Projected battery life, sodium-ion NFPP chemistry
    *   **-40°C to +55°C:** Operating range without HVAC

**Section 2: How It Works — Open Protocol Integration**
*   **Headline:** Seamless Integration. Total Flexibility.
*   **Sub-headline:** BESS Core cabinets are designed for integrators. We provide a simple, robust DC block with open-protocol BMS communication (Modbus TCP) that works with any inverter and any software stack.
*   **Diagram:** Simple block diagram showing:
    *   PV Array → Inverter → BESS Core Cabinet → Grid/Load
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Flexible Inverter Compatibility:** Works with any major inverter brand.
    *   **Modbus TCP:** Simple, reliable BMS communication.
    *   **Air-Cooled:** No HVAC or liquid cooling loops to manage.
    *   **IP54 Outdoor Rated:** Direct install, no building required.

**Section 3: Technology Comparison — Sodium-Ion vs. Lead-Acid & LFP**
*   **Headline:** The Clear Advantage
*   **Sub-headline:** A side-by-side look at how Coulomb Technology’s sodium-ion chemistry outperforms legacy technologies across every key metric.
*   **Table 1: Sodium-Ion vs. Lead-Acid** (from brochure)
*   **Table 2: Sodium-Ion vs. LFP** (new table)
    *   **Feature:** Cycle Life, Safety (Thermal Runaway), Temperature Range, Supply Chain, Cost

**Section 4: Why Sodium-Ion?**
*   **Headline:** The Battery That Solves What Lithium Can’t
*   **Sub-headline:** Three critical problems hold back lithium-ion in industrial and defense applications. Coulomb Technology’s sodium-ion chemistry eliminates all three.
*   **Tabs:** Safety & Fire Risk, Extreme Temperature, Supply Chain & Cost (reuse from home page)
